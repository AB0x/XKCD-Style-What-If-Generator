            const xkcdPrompt = `
                Write an article in the style of XKCD's "What If?" series for the user-provided topic: "${topic}". 
                Follow these guidelines to capture Randall Munroe’s signature style:
                - Start with a casual, witty intro that frames "${topic}" as a wild, impractical question worth exploring.
                - Blend real science (e.g., basic physics, biology, or math) with exaggerated, humorous speculation—feel free to invent plausible-sounding numbers or equations (like "10^23 pancakes per second").
                - Include at least one absurd analogy or scenario (e.g., a dinosaur doing something unexpected, a stack of everyday objects reaching the Moon).
                - Use a conversational tone with nerdy asides, silly tangents, and a touch of dry humor.
                - Explore both small-scale (e.g., what happens to one person) and large-scale (e.g., global or cosmic) effects of "${topic}".
                - Aim for 750-1000 words (~1000 tokens) to fully unpack the ridiculousness and science.
                - Wrap up with a quirky conclusion or punchline that ties it all together, leaving the reader amused.
                Example: For "What if everyone jumped at once?" you might calculate the Earth’s wobble, then wonder if we’d accidentally launch Florida into space while a T-Rex cheers us on.

            // Mock response with enhanced XKCD style
            const mockArticle = `
                <h2>What If: ${topic}</h2>
                <p>So, you’ve tossed out "${topic}" like it’s no big deal, huh? Well, strap in, because we’re about to take this idea, shake it like a snow globe, and see what falls out—probably something equal parts genius and deranged, XKCD-style. Let’s dive into the science, the silliness, and the inevitable chaos.</p>
                
                <p>Right off the bat, let’s imagine "${topic}" isn’t just a hypothetical—it’s happening, right now. Say it’s something like “what if all the world’s pencils turned into jellybeans?” First, we’d lose about 15 billion pencils (a number I pulled from thin air, but it sounds pencil-y). That’s roughly 10^11 grams of wood and graphite morphing into sugary globs. If each jellybean weighs 1 gram, we’re talking 100,000 metric tons of candy appearing overnight. Einstein’s E = MC² says that’s 9 × 10^24 joules of energy released—or absorbed?—in the switcheroo, enough to confuse every physicist and power a jellybean cannon to Mars.</p>
                
                <p>Picture yourself in this mess: you’re at your desk, ready to doodle, and bam—your pencil’s a jellybean. You’d shrug, eat it, and then realize your whole office is now a candy store. On a small scale, this is a sugar rush waiting to happen—dentists would riot. Zoom out, and it’s pandemonium: schools grind to a halt, architects can’t draw blueprints, and every standardized test becomes a snack break. The global economy teeters as we trade lead for lemon flavor. Someone’s calculating the GDP impact, but their pencil’s gone, so they’re just licking a strawberry bean in despair.</p>
                
                <p>Let’s crank it up a notch. If "${topic}" is bigger—like “what if the ocean turned into chocolate syrup?”—we’re in cosmic territory. The oceans hold 1.3 × 10^21 liters of water, so that’s now syrup with a density of, say, 1.3 kg/L (because chocolate’s heavier than water, obviously). That’s 1.7 × 10^21 kilograms of gooey goodness sloshing around. Tides would get sticky, ships would sink under the weight of deliciousness, and fish would evolve into dessert toppings overnight. The Earth’s rotation might slow from the extra drag—think 0.001 seconds per day, tops—while the Moon looks down, jealous it didn’t get the memo.</p>
                
                <p>Here’s the absurd bit: imagine a T-Rex wading through this chocolate ocean, holding a giant spoon it can’t use because, y’know, tiny arms. That’s the vibe of "${topic}". If it’s something like “what if dogs could talk?” you’d hear Rover demand treats in perfect English while plotting a coup. The average dog weighs 20 kg, so if 1 billion dogs worldwide start yapping, that’s 20 billion kilos of sass added to the planet. Linguists would scramble to decode “woof” dialects, and the internet would drown in memes—E = MC², where E is “Endless barking,” M is “Massive confusion,” and C is “Canine chaos squared.”</p>
                
                <p>Humans would adapt, sort of. If "${topic}" is “what if we all woke up as balloons?” you’d float to work, tethered to your coffee mug. The atmosphere would gain 8 billion buoyant bodies, each displacing about 0.1 cubic meters of air (humans are mostly water, but balloons are mostly helium vibes). Weather reports would include “chance of coworker drift,” and birds would file complaints. On the plus side, helium shortages would end, and birthday parties would get weirdly personal.</p>
                
                <p>So, "${topic}" isn’t just a question—it’s a glorious train wreck of science and nonsense. Whether it’s jellybean pencils or balloon people, the world would stumble, laugh, and probably invent a new holiday to celebrate the absurdity. In the end, reality would hand us a calculator, a stick figure drawing, and a note saying, “Figure it out, nerds—I’m off to eat the Moon.”</p>
